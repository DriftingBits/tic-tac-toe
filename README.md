# Tic-tac-toe
My first Java project. I tried to make a three-in-a-row game from scratch using multiple files.
The GameHandler.java file contains the main method and is probarbly the best place to start looking :)

All feedback is welcome!

To run this you could follow these instructions:<br>
Step 1 - download and unzip the files<br>
Step 2 - cd into the directory (with cmd)<br>
Step 3 - javac *.java<br>
Step 4 - java GameHandler<br>
